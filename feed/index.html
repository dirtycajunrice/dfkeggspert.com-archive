<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Introduction</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">One of the questions I see pop up a lot on Discord, Reddit and Twitter is the idea of finding the ideal match between a hero and a pet. There are a few criteria you need to consider as to why you&#8217;d pair certain pets with certain heroes and like with many other aspects of DFK there is more than one way to skin this particular cat. Hopefully this speggulative piece will give you a better idea as to how you may want to prioritise.<br><br>Oh, and this is going to be a long one (TWSS), so strap in!<br>(&#8230;TAWSS)</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Are Pets Even Important?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">We don&#8217;t know much about the majority of bonuses that pets offer. We&#8217;ve got a few ideas, hints and small bits of intel that have been dropped. I&#8217;ve got a list of all current known <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/pets/pet-bonuses/" data-type="page" data-id="2441" target="_blank">Pet Bonuses here</a>. With only analogous concepts of what crafting will look like in DFK (beyond &#8216;gather X to make Y&#8217;), and PVP still pretty far away still (yet seemingly within touching distance after recent announcements), there&#8217;s a been the biggest focus on the Profession Bonuses as they&#8217;re the first to be revealed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But forget the bonuses we see on the cards for a moment, because there&#8217;s one bonus as yet unseen that has no counter-argument:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">XP boosts. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Back in June at the DCentral event in Austin, we got teased with this slide:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-attachment-id="4080" data-permalink="https://dfkeggspert.com/feeding-pets-speggulation/austin-pet-alpha-drop/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?fit=1247%2C697&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1247,697" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?fit=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?fit=525%2C293&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" width="525" height="293" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?resize=525%2C293&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4080" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?resize=1024%2C572&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?resize=768%2C429&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?resize=1200%2C671&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Austin-Pet-Alpha-Drop.png?w=1247&amp;ssl=1 1247w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-center">This, based on what Dreamer said as part of that keynote speech, strongly suggested that ALL pets would give an XP bonus to the heroes they&#8217;re equipped to. After two months of trying to argue this point on the Discord, I then sought clarity on the matter by submitting the question for an AMA. Hubert had this to say:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center">
<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8220;The XP bonuses will be available from the start once we get pet bonuses activated. They apply to whatever quest is associated with that pet type. If its a fishing pet youâ€™ll get an XP bonus plus whatever bonus it has if you are doing a fishing quest. XP bonus is purely based on the rarity of the pet. The more rare, the bigger the bonus.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So, not only do all pets give XP (called it), but the amount of XP pets give increases with the rarity of the pet. This also settled another argument I was on the right side of (not that I&#8217;m counting) in that I suggested there would be a difference between, say, a Legendary pet with a Rare prof bonus and an Uncommon pet with the same Rare prof bonus. It was said early days that there&#8217;d be &#8220;hardly any difference&#8221; and some people took that to mean none at all, but hey &#8211; language is important. But, back to the matter at hand&#8230;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At the time of writing we still don&#8217;t know what those XP bonuses are going to be, but we do know that they&#8217;ll increase the rate at which heroes level up. More XP = faster levels. Faster levels = increase in value. We know this already as the top heroes in the game right now that have been juiced to the hilt (with stamina potions by people with insane bags) are worth a fortune compared heroes that have been questing and levelling organically.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Long story short, pets will make your heroes level faster which will increase their value over comparable heroes that don&#8217;t have pets equipped. So, yeah. Pretty essential. It&#8217;s also now put more value on the rarity of the pets themselves, whereas previously values were mostly derived from the rarity of the bonuses.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Cost Effectiveness</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What&#8217;s that? You&#8217;ve seen/heard that feeding pets won&#8217;t always be profitable if a) you&#8217;re using pets with common bonuses with b) low level heroes that are only just at profession score 10 or over? So yeah, that&#8217;s true.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So how can pets be essential if they&#8217;re not profitable? Well, that&#8217;s where investment comes in. The increased loot yield that you get from the profession bonus on a pet might not, in isolation, generate enough value in looted items to cover the cost of feeding the pets. As such, you might well be questing almost at a loss if your pet/hero is just scraping the grade. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But, as I just illustrated, the increase in XP gain that you get from equipping the pets will ensure your hero levels faster, which will allow you to boost its stats faster, which will make it a more effective quester faster &#8211; whilst also maintaining and improving its value.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The Level 10 Profession Quests will likely see Profession Scores go up to either 30 or 40, and like with the L0PQs it&#8217;ll be easier to increase that level at the bottom end (eg 20-30) than it will be at the top (eg 30-40). So if you&#8217;ve got a hero with a prof score of around 10-13, the L10PQs will boost that score even faster. As such, it won&#8217;t be long at all before your hero that&#8217;s operating at a small loss (I wouldn&#8217;t expect pets to be a massive resource drain) with their pet to be breaking even and then operating at a greater profit than they would without the pet.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Crafting</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There were six types of crafting listed on the pet catalog filter &#8211; Blacksmithing, Goldsmithing, Armorsmithing, Woodworking, Leatherworking and Tailoring. But, with the release of the blue and grey eggs, we only saw four of those, with Blacksmithing and Leatherworking nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Of the pet bonuses that are out, if we look at the breakdown of the mythic bonuses compiled by Twitter user Starbuck, there&#8217;s some useful information:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="525" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s Mythic Monday and it&#39;s time for some updated DFK Mythic pet totals through 8/8/22 9:11 pm PST<br><br>Combat 750<br>Fishing 533<br>Foraging 499<br>Woodworking 264<br>Goldsmithing 236<br>Tailoring 125<br>Armorsmithing 117<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotMineDOTW?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NotMineDOTW</a> pet#29809<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DFK?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DFK</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DefiKingdoms?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DefiKingdoms</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DFKpets?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DFKpets</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ONE</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24Jewel&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$Jewel</a>  <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThatStarbuck?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ThatStarbuck</a></p>&mdash; Starbuck (@SirStarbuck) <a href="https://twitter.com/SirStarbuck/status/1556860193941532674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 9, 2022</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-center">From this analysis, we can see that there are almost twice as many Woodworking and Goldsmithing bonuses than there are Tailoring and Armorsmithing. So why is that? Well, that&#8217;s because the Woodworking and Goldsmithing bonuses can be found on pets from both the blue and the grey eggs. Tailoring bonuses can only be found on pets from the blue egg, and Armorsmithing bonuses can only be found on pets from grey eggs. This suggests that both the Arm/Tail bonuses will likely also be seen on one of the next two eggs, i.e. the yellow and green. And, from that, we can almost guarantee that Blacksmithing and Leatherworking will be found on pets from both yellow and green eggs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If you don&#8217;t believe me about the crafting bonuses, feel free to try to find evidence that contradicts me on the wonderful resource <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkanalytics.com/pet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dfkanalytics.com/pet" target="_blank">DFK Analytics</a> &#8211; the best way to find pets to buy based on the criteria that matters to you.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The easiest way for me to illustrate egg colour relative to crafting type, have a look at this illustration by DFK heavyweight nous:</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img data-attachment-id="4660" data-permalink="https://dfkeggspert.com/pets-crafting-elements-and-hero-matching/dfk_-_elements_crafts_profs_final/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?fit=1008%2C952&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="1008,952" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?fit=300%2C283&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?fit=525%2C496&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?resize=504%2C476&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4660" width="504" height="476" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?w=1008&amp;ssl=1 1008w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?resize=300%2C283&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DFK_-_Elements_crafts_profs_FINAL.jpg?resize=768%2C725&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 504px) 100vw, 504px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-center">Ignoring elements for just a moment longer, and knowing that the green and yellow eggs will support Leatherworking and Blacksmithing, we can also confidently predict that the green egg will be the second egg to produce pets with the Woodworking bonus and that the yellow egg will hatch pets that could have Armorsmithing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Nobody knows what the Golden Eggs are going to do yet (except skyrocket in price because people are impatient), so stand by for more information.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So now we know which eggs produce pets that can roll which crafting bonuses, it&#8217;s also fair to say that with most of the Serendale 1.0 blue/grey eggs having been hatched, it&#8217;s unlikely we&#8217;ll see a massive increase in the number of Goldsmithing/Woodworking bonuses go up when the next batch of pets are released. So, grab &#8217;em whilst/if you can, etc.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Elements</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It may not have been immediately obvious, but there&#8217;s only one element for each of the different types of crafting. Again, this can be verified on DFK Analytics.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Armorsmithing = Earth<br>Woodworking = Wind<br>Goldsmithing = Water<br>Tailoring = Ice</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Now, it&#8217;s just speggulation at this stage, but nous posited (and sold me on the idea) that it would likely be the Fire element that&#8217;s associated with Blacksmithing (you know, because, weapons require a forge and all that) which would mean that Leatherworking is likely to be associated with Lightning. Light and Dark are two elements that oppose each other very directly and have a more direct relationship than any two other elements in the game. So it&#8217;s very likely that pets with Light and Dark elements are going to spawn from the Gold Eggs which are said to have &#8220;unique bonuses&#8221;.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Believe what you will at this stage!</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Hero Crafting</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So crafting will be performed in game by heroes. Whereas the crafting we&#8217;ve seen so far &#8211; the Alchemist and the Stone Carver &#8211; are effectively just ingame shops with a complex pricing system, heroes themselves will have to craft in DFK as far as the above elements are concerned.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What we didn&#8217;t know previously is what would determine a hero&#8217;s effectiveness at crafting, which has made &#8216;matching pets&#8217; for crafting purposes pretty difficult. However, that changed when Hubert confirmed in the AMA on 18/08/22 that a hero&#8217;s element <em>will</em> affect crafting. When I followed that up in the chat, he said:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">So at least as far as heroes are concerned, their element will play a huge role in which crafting they specialize in. Was also good to know that heroes will have a Crafting Score similar to the Profession Score, so it&#8217;s likely that the Hero Element will have a similar affect on Crafting as the Profession Gene has on Profession Questing.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Hero and Pet Matching</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I think this is probably the most subjective part of the process, because you can equip a pet to a hero to boost its profession questing, crafting or combat (and XP, obvs). And heroes all have their strengths and weaknesses &#8211; even the floor heroes. Any floor hero can be a busy little worker be on the prof quests. Some heroes are better at profession questing than others, as will some heroes be better at crafting. Some will be better suited for PVE and PVP when those features are released.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Now obviously, if money was no issue then we&#8217;d all just buy the best heroes for each speciality and then the best pets to match them with. For most of us, life isn&#8217;t that simple.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Pets aren&#8217;t a technical requirement to facilitate heroes being able to do any of the above, either. So, it&#8217;ll become an art of making the best connections based on information we get when the actual bonuses are announced.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">For crafting, there&#8217;s no suggestion that a pet without a crafting bonus would assist a hero in crafting in any way. In fact, a lack of bonus would suggest it wouldn&#8217;t. As such, simply matching the element of a pet to the element of a hero is redundant if the pet doesn&#8217;t have a crafting bonus. On that note, the better approach would be to find or buy pets that have specific crafting bonuses and match those pets to heroes with the associated element. Here&#8217;s the image again for a reminder:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Before combat is released, I&#8217;d suggest the fastest way to level a hero would be to attach it to the highest rarity of a profession-matching pet that you have/can afford. The Level 1 Training Quests offer more XP than the L0PQs, but the L10PQs will offer even more XP still. Having a pet with an XP bonus equipped to a hero doing an L10PQ will ensure it&#8217;s gaining XP at the fastest possible rate. That way, you&#8217;re doing all you can to maximise the development of the heroes you want leading the charge for you when PVP is eventually released. After the combat bonuses are released, it&#8217;ll be a case of picking the best combat bonuses you have and giving them to your PVP squad(s), but as we can&#8217;t predict what those bonuses will be at this stage, we can&#8217;t do anything except continue to develop our best heroes and collecting as many combat bonuses as we can &#8211; the higher the better, ofc. Matching will then come later.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As for heroes who are bound to a life of profession questing, the only thing that matters is getting a profession bonus that matches the profession gene of your heroes. As mentioned earlier, I would try to have enough pets to have one per hero where affordable. And then, once you&#8217;ve got enough pets to have 1:1 pets:heroes, I&#8217;d then start trying to trade up and improve the pets you&#8217;ve got for better ones. </p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Pet Availability</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Of course, not everyone is going to be able to achieve 1:1 pets:heroes. Presently, with two of the five egg types &#8216;hatched&#8217; (excluding some CV eggs), there is just short of 1 pet for every ten heroes. When yellow/green/gold eggs hatch, based on the number of eggs unhatched in those colours, it&#8217;ll be closer to 1 pet for every five heroes. This might change slightly over time as egg drop rates are included in the pet bonuses (and might be higher in higher tier profession quests) but it&#8217;s unlikely that every hero will get a pet &#8211; this isn&#8217;t an Oprah Winfrey giveaway, they&#8217;re supposed to give an advantage. So once people see the use case for pets, it&#8217;s my opinion that the demand for pets will go up and the floor price will rise with it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Another thing to consider is the cost of pets. A mythic pet will likely set you back over 1500J, and that&#8217;s just for an entry-level mythic that doesn&#8217;t have three 3-star bonuses. But a pet with a single mythic bonus can cost from 250J-400J at the moment, so in theory you could buy three pets that had individual mythic bonuses for all disciplines for under 1,000J and just swap them round on your hero (subject to lengthy pet cooldowns for unequipping them from heroes to prevent abuse of bonuses). This would cover you in terms of the bonuses you could need for a hero (who in all likelihood would only be given one role at a time (questing/crafting/combat)) but is a more affordable way to do it. AND it would deplete the total pool of pets giving them all greater value. Not financial advice.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Congrats on making it this far (or having the good sense to skip to the end) &#8211; the TL;DR is that pets are going to have a HUGE impact in hero development and that the basic XP-for-all-pets bonuses is sufficient justification in itself to try to add some pets to your collection. But given how much they&#8217;re going to influence almost every other aspect of the game (including Duels, eventually, allegedly), I can&#8217;t see how anyone can continue to ignore their future potential.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Enjoy!</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Milestones</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In under 24 hours since launch, there have been over 15,000 DFK Duel matches played. Of those matches, around 3,500 unique wallets have taken part so far, which is a crazy amount of uptake for a new feature for an initial 24 hour period.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">According to the superb MrZipper, that breaks down as 43% of matches being 1v1s, 40% as 3v3s and a surprising 17% as 9v9s. Where are y&#8217;all getting all these heroes from?!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">More than six players have managed to reach Rank 2 so far as well, so a big well done to burnem, LORD BAKA, JL026, Katsukatsu, HarmonyWarrior and Sir Lil B for being the first to hit these dizzying heights. And whoever said money can&#8217;t buy you happiness, amiright?</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Feedback</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. There are still some people who seem to think it&#8217;s DFK&#8217;s version of PVP, despite all the many ways in which everyone has tried to make clear it isn&#8217;t. That&#8217;ll come with time, though! Nothing a little splainin&#8217; can&#8217;t fix.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The most common piece of constructive criticism is that there could be some improvements made to the matchmaking system. Because everyone started from Rank 1, it means that everyone got pooled together, from a one floor hero wallet to the wallets that fielded a bunch of Dreadknights. </p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There were many a small wallet success stories though taking down the Goliaths of DFK, which is fun to see even from a neutral perspective. And, once all the Billy Big Bags have ranked up (like the individuals who already hit Rank 2 above!) and their top-end heroes move up a bracket, it should make it easier for the rest of us to compete!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But, Frisky Fox has said they&#8217;re looking at how best to implement a Hero Level multiplier to the matchmaking system, so stay tuned. It&#8217;s great when devs listen to feedback.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Strategy</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There&#8217;s still a bit of confusion as to how best to implement the Boost (or how the Boost works, even) &#8211; so here&#8217;s the skinny: where possible, you want to group your heroes by matching stat and Background.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The reason being is that the Boost makes it 3x more likely for the stat you&#8217;ve chosen to be selected in each round of the Duel you&#8217;re in. So if you&#8217;re sending three heroes of the same stat, that&#8217;s a 3x boost for every round. Same with Backgrounds &#8211; if you&#8217;ve got three different backgrounds, the Boost only gives you one round of a 3x advantage. Nobody should be selecting a background that doesn&#8217;t feature on any of the Hero NFT cards you&#8217;re using. If you match a background AND you win the Element Dominance you can DOUBLE your stat&#8217;s score, so trying to match your highest stat to the one picked for the Duel and the Background chosen is definitely the way to go.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Community Tournaments</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Less than a day after DFK Duel went live, we saw our first Duel Tournament, organised by community member Adamantine. He put up the prize of a Green Egg for people to compete over and laid down the challenge to any soul brave enough to compete.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The inaugural DFK Show Down was won by r0wdy, and the whole competition was streamed by PRIMETIME on Twitch.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It&#8217;s just another great example of community initiative and making the most of the features we already have in DFK. Adamantine has said that these competitions will be running weekly, and then once they get to 16 unique winners they&#8217;ll have a Champions Tournament!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">To join the DFK Show Down Discord, click <a href="https://discord.gg/sWn7Fnpz" data-type="URL" data-id="https://discord.gg/sWn7Fnpz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Not a bad first day of DFK Duel! Not a bad first day at all!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If you have any great David vs Goliath stories for your Duels so far, hit me up on the DFK Discord &#8211; I&#8217;m normally around!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The pet on the left had a floor value of 50J. The one on the right had a floor value of 70J.<br><br>New eggs cost ~35J atm at the Trader.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if the other pet had been a floor pet with one single common bonus, these two (separate) people could have got TWO EGGS by selling the pets they didn&#8217;t want, rather than trading them in.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">So we know for definite that we&#8217;ll need to feed pets. We know it won&#8217;t be every day, and we know that it&#8217;ll require plants and fish.

<p class="has-text-align-center">Whereas we previously believed that pets would be eating actual plants and fish, from the quest loot of Foraging and Fishing, it now seems that these existing loot items would instead be used to &#8216;craft&#8217; a new kind of token &#8211; a &#8220;treat&#8221;.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center">
<p>Same with DFK, we need to feed the pets to get these special and unique buffs and bonuses on the heroes that they are attached to. That will come by way of treats. Treats will be made by consuming parts of the game that come from questing.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Speggulation on Feeding</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So we still don&#8217;t know for certain what tokens will be used for creating &#8216;treats&#8217;. But, let&#8217;s take a look at the options:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">I would say therefore that it&#8217;s unlikely to be the Silverfin, Sail Fish, Shimmerskin, Goldvein or Swift-Thistle based on the fact that they each have an approximately 1% drop rate in the current Level 0 Profession Quests. Of course, when the Level 10 Profession Quests drop this number might increase significantly making them more viable. But as they&#8217;re also worth the most gold, it might be that these are mostly for-profit items only.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">So what does that leave us?</h3>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Given that we know that the two eggs we&#8217;ve seen released so far have required two &#8216;burn&#8217; tokens to hatch eggs, if Gardening follows the same pattern it would be the Bluestem and Spiderfruit &#8211; Milkweed is again just that little bit too rare to be a sustainable source of food. There&#8217;s no guarantee that it will follow the same pattern, because what would we use to hatch yellow or gold eggs that wasn&#8217;t just more gold? And they already cost quite enough of that!</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">The Bloater Theory</h3>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It has long been part of a series of memes that Bloaters would be the sacrificial food of the pets. And in fact, in a bowl outside the Hatchery where Jarek is holding what appears to be two chickens, there sits a Bloater fish.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-attachment-id="4099" data-permalink="https://dfkeggspert.com/feeding-pets-speggulation/image-2-2/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-2.png?fit=296%2C268&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="296,268" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="image-2" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-2.png?fit=296%2C268&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-2.png?fit=296%2C268&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="296" height="268" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/image-2.png?resize=296%2C268&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-4099" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure></div>


<p class="has-text-align-center">Is that an homage to all the memes? Is it confirmation of what has been suspected for a while? We don&#8217;t know, but given the lack of use case for bloaters so far, it would be very surprising if they weren&#8217;t at least part of the ingredients for Pet Treats. Given that there&#8217;s more than twice as many Bloaters as any other loot item, similarly with Ragweed, I&#8217;d suggest these were the main two ingredients for pet food.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Frequency of Feeding</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Hubert said that feeding wouldn&#8217;t be a daily occurrence, I just assumed it would be weekly. But, all things considered, a week is a fairly arbitrary time frame to repeat actions within DFK. MrZipper posited that it could easily be a three day or five day cycle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">One other thing that was mentioned that I can&#8217;t find the quote on Discord for now is that pets would either provide a bonus, or not, depending on whether they&#8217;d been fed. So the bonuses won&#8217;t scale depending on how hungry they are.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I&#8217;ve reasoned that in order to track the feeding of pets and determine whether they&#8217;re hungry and need to be fed, it&#8217;s likely that there&#8217;d be a progress bar or some kind of visible representation to indicate this. This could be like a stamina bar that, when it gets to zero, would indicate the pet was hungry.  Or it could be a countdown clock similar to the summoning cooldown timer on Heroes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Supporting this theory is something else MrZipper identified, in that in the data set pertaining to Pets in the API, there&#8217;s a data field called &#8220;hungryAt&#8221;. This supports the theory that hunger is relative to when a Pet was fed, rather than it being a Sunday to feed pets, which would be both arbitrary and ambiguous.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Edit:<br>It was confirmed in an AMA by Hubert that feeding pets would amount to a length of time, not by number of quests taken part in. This means that it&#8217;ll be slightly more cost effective for people using stam pots as you won&#8217;t need to feed the pets more often just because you&#8217;ve quested a bunch of times in quick success through the use of stamina potions. I say &#8216;slightly&#8217; as feeding pets shouldn&#8217;t be prohibitively expensive, as you&#8217;ll be earning rewards faster anyway through the Level 10 Profession Quests.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Cost of Feeding</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It might not be as simple as &#8220;Pet eat Bloater  Treat&#8221; or &#8220;Pet eat Ragweed Treat&#8221;, as there was some suggestion from Hubert that the cost of feeding pets might make it &#8220;unprofitable&#8221; to equip and feed pets to Heroes that aren&#8217;t sufficiently levelled. Now we know already that Heroes will have to be Profession Score 10 in order to take part in the Level 10 Profession Quests, but there&#8217;s a graph here that Hubert shared that was interesting:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">So from this, it might not be as cheap as chips to feed pets. So a Hero that&#8217;s <em>just</em> passed the Profession Score 10 mark with crap profession stats (remember it&#8217;s LCK+AGI for Fishing and DEX+INT for Foraging) might not find it cost-effective to feed a pet with a Common profession bonus. That&#8217;s not to say that you automatically <em>shouldn&#8217;t do it</em>, because the XP bonuses you get from questing the higher tier of quests AND the XP boost you get from equipping a pet should boost your ranks pretty quickly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And, like the L0PQs, when you first start doing them you increase your profession score pretty quickly. It&#8217;s only as your Prof Score heads towards 10 (and beyond) that it starts slowing down &#8211; you hit boost less often and by small increments. The L10PQs are designed to boost your Prof Score <em>beyond</em> 10 and well into the 20s, so we might find that our profession scores get quickly boosted by the L10PQs if our heroes are sitting with low qualifying Prof Scores. This effectively means that it hopefully wouldn&#8217;t take long for even the lower scoring heroes to start turning a profit with pets and so might be worth taking the initial loss in order to secure a greater yield sooner rather than later.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A lot of this is speggulation derived from observable data, which to be honest isn&#8217;t very much in places. Either way, it shouldn&#8217;t be too long before we see the L10PQs and the ability to equip our pets. DFK Duels is released on the 15th June and with &#8220;Level 10 Fishing and Foraging&#8221; currently on the Roadmap for &#8220;Q3&#8221;, it might not be until early July that we see this feature launched, but that still isn&#8217;t very long in the grand scheme.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Either way, I hope this offered some insight! Comment below if you&#8217;ve seen anything relating to Pet Feeding that I&#8217;ve missed!</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">TL;DR</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Nope.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-attachment-id="2455" data-permalink="https://dfkeggspert.com/pets/hatching-pets/east-market-gif/" data-orig-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/East-Market-GIF.gif?fit=800%2C501&amp;ssl=1" data-orig-size="800,501" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="East-Market-GIF" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/East-Market-GIF.gif?fit=300%2C188&amp;ssl=1" data-large-file="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/East-Market-GIF.gif?fit=525%2C329&amp;ssl=1" decoding="async" loading="lazy" width="525" height="329" src="https://i0.wp.com/dfkeggspert.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/East-Market-GIF.gif?resize=525%2C329&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-2455" data-recalc-dims="1"/></figure>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Longer Answer</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Imagine a lottery ticket costs $2. But as it&#8217;s a rollover, you actually want to buy a second ticket. Double your chances, right? But when you go to pay, the cost of two tickets is $10.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That&#8217;s roughly the difference between Gaia&#8217;s Grace and Gaia&#8217;s Boon. Only, your chances of getting a better pet aren&#8217;t even twice as good &#8211; only the chance at a Mythic is twice as good (100% better). Your chances of getting a Legendary aren&#8217;t double (only 50% better), your chances of getting a Rare aren&#8217;t double (only 33.33% better) and chances of getting an Uncommon are only 16.16% better.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">For five times the amount of Jewel and Gold, I just don&#8217;t think think it&#8217;s worth it. And having to wait 24 hours for the pets to hatch isn&#8217;t a massive inconvenience compared to the 20 seconds for the Boon.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Besides&#8230; imagine paying 50J for an Egg in the Trader, 50J to hatch it (plus extra) and then getting rugged with a common pet with a single common bonus and seeing that these pets are going for 35-40J in the Hatchery. Hard pass from me. Twice bitten, etc!</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Comparing Grace to Favor</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Favor is the cheapest option, costing just one Jewel and 50 Gold to hatch (along with the rest of the fees which are consistent and not insignificant &#8211; see <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/pets/hatching-pets/?highlight=pets#cost-of-hatching-pets" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dfkeggspert.com/pets/hatching-pets/?highlight=pets#cost-of-hatching-pets" target="_blank">hatching costs</a> for a full breakdown) and is therefore the most accessible option.</p>



<p>Costs of Grace compared to Favor is ten times the price. The Pet hatches in 24 hours for Grace compared to one week for Favor, which is &#8211; as advertised &#8211; seven times faster. But to be honest, it&#8217;s what comes out the other side that matters, not how long it takes to come out. So again let&#8217;s look at the percentages.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It&#8217;s ten times more expensive to go for Grace rather than Favor. That&#8217;s 1000% more Jewel and Gold. But, for Mythic chances, it&#8217;s 0.2% to 1%, which is five times more likely. Or 500%. At this point, the difference in price is much more proportionate than Grace to Boon. For Legendary chances, it&#8217;s 100% more likely going from Favor to Grace (2% chance going up to 4% chance), which is still okay. But Rare only goes up 20% (from 12.5% chance to 15% chance) and Uncommon only goes up 11.11% (12.5% chance to 15%).</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So at the top end, it&#8217;s a more worthwhile step up in going for glory doing Favor to Grace, but at the lower end the pet rarity the difference is rather negligible. So, ultimately I&#8217;d say this was a judgement call. The extra 9 Jewel and 450 Gold isn&#8217;t as big a difference to your wallet as the extra 40J and 4500 Gold from Grace to Boon, and for higher rarities represents better value.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ultimately it comes down to what you can afford, though. Either way, I hope you enjoy whatever pets you get as even the floor pets are fun additions to the game. And we&#8217;ll all wish we had a pet for every hero once the L10 Profession Quests come out, so don&#8217;t go hating on floor pets just yet!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">With PVP being one of the most anticipated features of DFK, it&#8217;s only natural that people want to know more about it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The following question was asked in an AMA (found <a href="https://medium.com/@Samichpunch/defi-kingdoms-team-ama-game-mechanics-team-april-11-2022-8851b7e82ca3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>):</p>



<h4 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading"><strong><em>I know there will be limitations for combat based on blockchain tech, one might be a gambit system like in FF12?</em></strong></h4>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Which was answered:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;We are planning on doing something like a gambit system for combat. We have a working prototype we are testing with now. Itâ€™s pretty far along, thereâ€™s a lot more to go with it, but that is generally the direction we are going with the combat system. As far as what you will do with your hero, you will set up their AI and what they will do in PVP and PVE. That hopefully answers most of your questions.&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211; Hubert</cite></blockquote>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Yes we are looking at a gambit like system for combat&#8221;</p><cite>&#8211; Bolon</cite></blockquote>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">What is a Gambit System?</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A gambit system, specifically the one in FF12 as referenced in the question, is explained in a YouTube video by The Inner Grove with Samichpunch and Babypunch, which has a lot of great explanations and insight in to how to play with a gambit system:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Hey everyone. This is the first post of this kind that I&#8217;ve been able to put together, but was actually one of the main reasons I started putting this site together. Whilst some people might tune into AMAs, catch some Twitter posts or read an artcile on Medium, it&#8217;s still really easy to miss some information.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The following is a collection of information about the upcoming Pets release that might be of interest to you.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">The Cost of Hatching Pets</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There are still no definitive prices / list of tokens that we&#8217;ll need to incubate the pets. After yesterday&#8217;s great preview (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/medium-extract-pets-update-21-may-22/" data-type="post" data-id="2272" target="_blank">covered here</a>) of some of the features, we know that there&#8217;ll be three tiers of incubation that will affect chances of summoning a mythic pet and the speed at which pets are incubated:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">So. Gaia&#8217;s Favor, Gaia&#8217;s Grace and Gaia&#8217;s Boon. Great. We still don&#8217;t know how much they cost or what they&#8217;ll cost, though. However, here&#8217;s some information that might narrow things down for you:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">I suggested yesterday that Gaia&#8217;s Boon was going to be expensive, but over five times as expensive as Gaia&#8217;s Grace is definitely going to be on the steep side.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Utility</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">To round everything off, there&#8217;s just a couple more comments about utility of eggs. First one is confirmation that blue eggs will hatch pets that can spawn with Fishing bonuses, grey eggs with Foraging, etc&#8230; but all pets that hatch can have almost any other type of bonuses, except for Gold Eggs which have some unique utility that&#8217;s yet to be revealed.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Jarek is skilled in the ways of coaxing Gaiaâ€™s energies into an egg, and provides the choice of three different offerings that Gaia can provide. Each offering has a different cost associated with it, with incubation time, and shiny and rarity chances improving for the higher cost options.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">We already knew that there was going to be an incubation time based on previous information and AMA info drops, but this is the first of us knowing that there&#8217;d be different options/costs involved for chances at spawning higher rarity and shiny pets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Also, the post mentions Jarek, but we know what Jarek looks like and that ain&#8217;t quite him. Quick reminder as to Jarek&#8217;s original appearance:</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">This tiered pricing system is interesting. I can imagine the prices for Gaia&#8217;s Grace and Gaia&#8217;s Boon being exceptionally high, otherwise everyone would just select Gaia&#8217;s Boon every time. Gotta have those Mythic pets&#8230;</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Pets come in a great variety of shapes and sizes. Rarity will play a role in what kind of pet you can find, and even within a given rarity there are rare variant appearances to find! But that is not all. The utility of pets comes from what they provide to the Heroes that own and feed them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Feed pets? Tamagotchis confirmed! I just really hope I can keep any pets I have alive for longer than 3 days. Also hoping we don&#8217;t have to clean up pet poop. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see what it is we have to feed pets, but if the picture above is anything to go by, it might well be fish&#8230;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Each pet will have a guaranteed Profession bonus, and have a chance at receiving a combat or crafting bonus (or both!) based on their rarity. Furthermore, each bonus itself has a rarity tier which is indicated by the number of stars next to the icon. Unlike pets and Heroes, pet bonuses only have three rarity tiers: Common (1 star), Rare (2 stars), and Mythic (3 stars). The chance of getting higher rarity bonuses is tied to the rarity of the pet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p class="has-text-align-center">I think having different rarities for pets AND different rarities for abilities is a great thing. This also confirmed that while the pet bonuses would only have three tiers of rarity, the pets themselves would have five (which would include Uncommon and Legendary, presumably). I&#8217;m still gonna end up with nothing but Common Pets with single Common bonuses because I angered RNGesus in a previous life.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Also while we knew that pets would support heroes in PVE/PVP &#8211; having them offer support in crafting as well is actually a big deal. Will this mean that players get discounts at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/serendale/the-alchemist/" data-type="page" data-id="59" target="_blank">The Alchemist</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/serendale/serendale-portal/stone-carver/" data-type="page" data-id="2090" target="_blank">Stone Carver</a>? I hope so &#8211; the Stone Carver costs a <em>fortune</em>.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;The initial pet release will come with some caveats. First, only grey and blue eggs will be supported at launch. Creating art for all of these pets is a monumental task, and our art team is still hard at work on the art for the other three eggs. Second, pet bonuses will be set to placeholders until the respective features are closer to launch. In the case of profession bonuses, the wait will not be long. They are planned to be implemented along with the release of the level 10 Fishing and Foraging quests. For all bonuses that contain a placeholder, you will be able to see the rarity and type of bonuses (combat, profession, crafting, etc.) that the pet has, but not the details of what the bonus actually does. Here is a sneak peak of some of the bonuses available:</p><p>&#8211; <a href="https://dfkeggspert.com/shvas-rune-drop-rates-and-pets/" data-type="post" data-id="1589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Increased chance of finding runes</a><br>&#8211; Increased experience gains<br>&#8211; Extra item rolls<br>&#8211; Skill improvements<br>And more!&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">We already knew that the Blue and Grey Eggs would be the first that owners could take to the Hatchery. We also knew that the first of the Level 10 Profession Quests would be limited to Fishing and Foraging, so this tracks. The bonuses offered look like they&#8217;ll be great though and really gives an indication as to how much depth DFK is going to have within the world of questing going forward. A lot of people see questing as placeholder activity before PVE and PVP comes out, but it&#8217;s got so much to it that we&#8217;ll need to keep investing in as the game goes on. As we&#8217;ll always need loot to craft with to aid our heroes in combat, having bonuses applied to questing will make them enormously useful in the long term.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And those bonuses look sexy AF.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;This feature will also launch with a trade-in mechanic to put up two unwanted pets for adoption by townsfolk in exchange for one new egg.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A floor pet burn function will be of great interest to a lot of people, especially people like me who&#8217;ll have nothing but common/common pet derivatives. It also sets a wonderfully interesting precedent for a similar hero burning feature in the future, which is often asked about and skirted around during AMAs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Just for info:</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;The current plan is for green and yellow eggs to be ready next, with gold eggs finishing off the collection.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This was a butt-tonne of information dropped about pets and more than we&#8217;ve had in any of the AMAs to date. Will continue to keep the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dfkeggspert.com/category/pets/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://dfkeggspert.com/category/pets/" target="_blank">Upcoming Features &#8211; Pets</a> section  updated before having a full post covering all the pet information I can get my hands on.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Duels can be fought in groups of 1, 3, or 9 Heroes, with varying levels of rewards for each tier. As you win matches, your score will increase and you will climb the ranks, facing ever more challenging opponents.&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So this is new information. Previously, we only knew of the ability to compete in 1v1 card battles, so the fact that there are more varieties to this is huge! It is great that they are still doing the 1v1 battles as a lot of players who are just beginning their DFK journey don&#8217;t necessarily have a collection of heroes to fight with.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;There is a brand new matchmaking system, which pairs players in lobbies based on their rank. Winners of duels will earn Raffle Tickets, which can be used to enter multiple raffles (hourly, daily, and weekly) to win prizes!&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This is also new information. Previously it was uncertain what players would be competing for, or what incentive there would be to participate (beyond it being awesome and bragging rights, etc). The matchmaking system had been suggested before, and it&#8217;ll be curious to see how that works.<br><br>A certain other third party application uses a pooling system, with all heroes level 1 to 4 able to fight against one another, and then all heroes level 5 to 9 in a different pool, etc. Whilst this prevents heroes that are level 1 fighting heroes that are level 9, it still means the system is easily gamed by entering in single heroes at level 4 or level 9 for the maximum chances of winning. Hopefully there&#8217;s a more technical solution being looked into by the official DFK product.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">I&#8217;m curious as to whether the above image suggests that all duels will have unique IDs and can therefore be viewed, via some sort of catalogue, by anyone. This would be fantastic as it would allow for people to easily immerse themselves in the Duels without necessarily having to take part themselves.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Also good for bragging rights if you win. I&#8217;m curious in the future whether it would be possible to arrange private duels and challenge specific people. Time will tell!</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote has-text-align-center"><p>&#8220;Heroes will get bonuses based on their elements, card backgrounds, and stats, so make sure to send your best teams in! We are working to provide a more in depth guide going over all the details of DFK Duel! Stay tuned!&#8221;</p></blockquote>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So we&#8217;d been told previously at some point that the &#8216;elements&#8217; and &#8216;backgrounds&#8217; of a hero&#8217;s card would come into play later in the game, but historically this was associated with the upcoming PVE and PVP element of the game. Whilst Duels are player vs player, it&#8217;s not the same version of PVP which is due to come out later in the year. It&#8217;s interesting that these components are coming into play so early and it might start playing a bigger factor into how players Buy or Summon heroes. More to come on that later!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Also exciting is the amount of detail going into the guides that accompany new releases of DFK now. Before the Training Quests, new features were generally just thrown into a ravenous pit of eager players and left for people to work it out for themselves (or wait until Samichpunch of MrZipper told them how to use them). This is a great improvement to DFK and makes uptake on new features significantly easier!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">This is a fun preview of what the Duels are going to look like. If you see the elements in the centre of the bottom there, it looks like they&#8217;re may work a bit like Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock &#8211; but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Conclusion</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ultimately we&#8217;ve had to wait a while for heroes to have more utility than just questing, as fun and productive as that can be for NFTs. I mean, how many other NFTs can earn you money without having to sell them on? The little money printers!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This is set to be a great milestone in the DFK journey and we can&#8217;t wait for this to drop in June 22!</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">(Spoiler alert: it&#8217;s a long post. It&#8217;s not compulsory reading and doesn&#8217;t apply to everyone)</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Some Background</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">So just recently the community and project of DeFi Kingdoms was subjected to an organised FUD campaign designed to try and derail the project.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What&#8217;s FUD, you say? It&#8217;s an acronym &#8211; it stands for &#8220;Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt&#8221;. It&#8217;s commonly used to describe the actions of individuals or groups of individuals who, through toxicity and misinformation, attempt to shake or destroy the confidence of investors in a project. This can be done for many reasons, either just out of spite or most commonly to try to manipulate the market for personal gain.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It would be pointless to go into too much detail about the nature of this recent wave of fud as the project has come out of the other side, stronger in some ways for it. Besides, I&#8217;m sure  most of it would be dismissed in a court of law as speculation or hearsay. Innit, Amber?</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">The Current Problem</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The position the project is in now is a lot stronger. The team surrendered a lot of its anonymity and with a shift towards legitimising the team behind the armour of company registration there&#8217;s significantly fewer baseless accusations that can be made. The devs kept building throughout, we&#8217;ve had CV Gen0&#8217;s, the Stone Carver, Training Quests and are about to get Pets. The game is going from strength to strength.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The community took a bit of a beating, though. It&#8217;s hard to describe the effects it&#8217;s had without sounding totally melodramatic. But, for context, there was this massive project that we all knew and loved and were personally and financially invested in&#8230; and it was being attacked. And worst of all, not only could we see it happen, we could see who was doing it. It was, for lack of a better word, a traumatic experience.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As with any experience that could be described as traumatic, it&#8217;s left some scars. As a community, we see signs that we are collectively less trusting, less forgiving and certainly less patient. Too quick are we, sometimes, to assume fud and react defensively. We see terms that previously wouldn&#8217;t have bothered us, like &#8220;project dead?&#8221; and &#8211; rather than try to nurture people and reassure them &#8211; it&#8217;s far too easy to mistake some instances of genuine concern for further attempts to hurt the project, or the community. In some cases, we risk alienating people or pushing people out of the project, which is almost as hurtful as the fud campaign that lead us here.</p>



<h2 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Healing</h2>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I think we all need to be able to put our hands up and say &#8220;I was affected by this, and to whatever degree, it has influenced how I perceive and react to comments within the community&#8221;. I think that if we acknowledge what we can do better, the healing process will go a lot faster and we&#8217;ll alienate fewer people as a result.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I&#8217;m just gonna put it out there &#8211; I&#8217;ve been far quicker to react defensively lately than I have been previously. I feel almost protective of DFK, especially after having personally invested so much in the project (not financial, obviously, I&#8217;m still a crypto shrimp) since I joined in January. And that was before I started putting this website together!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I really want to try to be a part of a shift in mentality that takes us back to where we were before. Collectively, we can do better. I&#8217;m not attacking anyone or singling anyone out, but there&#8217;s certainly some room for improvement in a general sense. We need to get ourselves out of a mindset where our first instinct is to protect what we have, and get us to a point where we look for opportunities to be decent to one another. To look for the person who may seem like they&#8217;re just being a dick, but actually might just need a bit of a hug.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It isn&#8217;t going to take some monumental effort to get us from where we are now, to where we were just very recently. We as a community have demonstrated how genuinely wonderful we can be to one another &#8211; familiar faces or otherwise &#8211; so it isn&#8217;t a case of trying to change who we are, more that we need to start being truer to who we are and focus on delivering the positive vibes. But, I do think that the first step has to be acknowledging there&#8217;s a problem and being willing to try to change it.</p>
